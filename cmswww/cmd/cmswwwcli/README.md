Use the token from your invitation email to register and follow the instructions:

#### Submit an invoice

Invoices must be in the following CSV format:

```
# 2018-12
# Type of work, Subtype of work, Description of work, Link to Politeia proposal, Hours worked, Total cost (in USD)
Development,,decred/politeia issue#36,,4,160
Development,,decred/politeia issue#38,,3,120
...
```

You can either create the file manually, or have the CLI create and update a file
for you, using the `logwork` command:

```
$ cmswwwcli logwork dec 2018

Type of work: Development
Subtype of work (optional):
Description of work: decred/politeia issue#36
Politeia proposal (optional):
Hours worked: 4
Total cost (in USD): 160
Work logged successfully.
```

When you're ready to submit the invoice for review, you can either submit the
one created and maintained by the CLI via the `logwork` command:

```
$ cmswwwcli submitinvoice dec 2018
```

Or submit your own CSV file:

```
$ cmswwwcli submitinvoice --invoice=<path to invoice CSV>

Invoice submitted successfully! The censorship record has been stored in ~/cmswww/cli/invoices/<email>/submission_record_2018-12_1.json for your future reference.
```

#### Editing a rejected invoice

If your invoice is rejected, you can edit and re-submit it:

```
$ cmswwwcli editinvoice <invoice token> <path to invoice CSV>

Invoice submitted successfully! The censorship record has been stored in ~/cmswww/cli/invoices/<email>/submission_record_2018-12_2.json for your future reference.
```

#### Setting email notification preferences

Contractors have the ability to get email notifications for changes to their invoices:

```
$ cmswwwcli edituser --emailnotifications=<num>
```

`<num>` is the result of adding the corresponding numbers for any combination of the following notification types:

| Description | Value |
|-|-|
| Invoice has been approved | `1` |
| Invoice has been rejected | `2` |
| Payment received for invoice | `4` |

For example, to only get notifications for when your invoices are approved or rejected, you will substitute `3` for `<num>` in the above command.

## Persisting Data Between Commands
`cmswwwcli` stores  user identity data (user's public/private key pair), session cookies, and CSRF tokens in the `~/cmswww/cli/` directory.  This allows you to login with a user and remain logged in between commands.  The user identity data and cookies are segmented by host, allowing you to login and interact with multiple hosts simultaneously.
